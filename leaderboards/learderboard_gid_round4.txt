However, there are several changes compared with FCN, U-Net is completely symmetrical, and the decoder (the concept of encoder and decoder should be put forward by Hinton, that is, the process of image-> high-semantic feature map as encoder, and the process of high-semantic-> pixel-level classification score map as decoder) is deepened by convolution, and FCN only carries out up-sampling.\r\nSkip connection: both use such a structure, although it seems to be quite common now, but at that time, the obvious benefits of such a structure were obvious to all, because it could combine high-level semantics with low-level fine-grained surface information, which well met the needs of segmentation for these two aspects of information.\r\nUnion: in FCN, the union of Skip connection is through the summation of the corresponding pixels, while U-Net is the concat process of its channel.",

Our team members are Meng Chang(cmeng_1@stu.xidian.edu.cn)\u200b, Hui Yiming(2995652875@qq.com), Zhang Jie(zhagnjie5662@163.com), Zhang Zixiao(zhangzx@stu.xidian.edu.cn) and Jiao Licheng(lchjiao@mail.xidian.edu.cn). After trying out many models for this contest, we decided to use the UNet and Deeplabv3+ networks. The effect of these two networks on GID15 remote sensing image is better than other models. We tried 256, 512 and 1024 clipping methods and used superposition clipping. Backbone has tried resnet and XCeption. Different crop sizes are generally good and bad, but there are subtle differences in single categories. We first cover these results optimally and get better results. The sizes of 512 and 1024 are used for prediction. Then test enhancements were added, including flips and color transformations. Test enhancements did not improve much in this experiment. After the statistical data, it was found that the categories with low MIOU accounted for a small proportion in the training set, and the distribution was unbalanced. To solve the problem of data imbalance, we conducted separate dichotomy training. The results of dichotomies are covered on the forecast map. Multiple predictions were made and voted on for several charts with poor predictions. The final vote is in multiple results.",

The reason is to take the advantages of multiscale training while being able to train with high resolution. The network is trained with 9 different scales (0.25,0.5,1.0,2.0,2.5,3.0,3.5,4.0). \r\nFor the details of dividing raw images, we split an input image into 113 smaller parts with resolution 900x850. We slide the 900x850 mask over the image with the stride [450, 425] for x and y axis respectively.\r\nThe post processing stage is combining multiple smaller results images into one single images. The smoothing process is also applied to the final outputs to improve the overall quality to makeup for the dividing step in the beginning.",
