The account name is the same as the team name. \u200b\u200b\u200bIt's my honor to participate in this competition. Our team members are Meng Chang(cmeng_1@stu.xidian.edu.cn)\u200b, Hui Yiming(2995652875@qq.com), Zhang Jie(zhagnjie5662@163.com), Zhang Zixiao(zhangzx@stu.xidian.edu.cn) and Jiao Licheng(lchjiao@mail.xidian.edu.cn). After trying out many models for this contest, we decided to use the UNet and Deeplabv3+ networks. The effect of these two networks on GID15 remote sensing image is better than other models. We tried 256, 512 and 1024 clipping methods and used superposition clipping. Backbone has tried resnet and XCeption. Different crop sizes are generally good and bad, but there are subtle differences in single categories. We first cover these results optimally and get better results. The sizes of 512 and 1024 are used for prediction. Then test enhancements were added, including flips and color transformations. Test enhancements did not improve much in this experiment. After the statistical data, it was found that the categories with low MIOU accounted for a small proportion in the training set, and the distribution was unbalanced. To solve the problem of data imbalance, we conducted separate dichotomy training. The results of dichotomies are covered on the forecast map. Multiple predictions were made and voted on for several charts with poor predictions. The final vote is in multiple results.",

            "description": "We propose a U-shaped model, which uses Resnet50 as the backbone network to sample the feature fusion module on top.For the shallow input we use High Frequcency Extractor (HFE) to extract the High frequency information of the image,At the same time, Muti-scale Convolution (MSC) is used to filter out unnecessary high-frequency signals so as to optimize cloud edges.For deep input, we use improved Spatial Prior self-attention (SPSA) mechanism to obtain distance information between classes, so as to strengthen the model's control over global information and make the model have better Spatial adaptability.In addition, we introduce Spatial Channel Attention Block (SCAB) to reduce the proportion of redundant information in the feature map. In order to make the model converge better and faster, we adopt the idea of skipping connection in the design of several modules.Using multiple Loss simultaneously for supervised learning. Our device is a single sheet RTX3080 with a video memory capacity of 10G and a batchsize of 4. Our initial learning rate is set as 0.01, Poly learning rate attenuation strategy is adopted, and SGD optimizer is used. A total of 200 iterations are carried out.",

We slide the 900x850 mask over the image with the stride [450, 425] for x and y axis respectively.\r\nThe post processing stage is combining multiple smaller results images into one single images. The smoothing process is also applied to the final outputs to improve the overall quality to makeup for the dividing step in the beginning.",
