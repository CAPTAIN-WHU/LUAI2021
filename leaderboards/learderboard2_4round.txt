            "description": "Our scheme for this challenge is mainly based on our oriented R-CNN, which was accepted for presentation at ICCV2021. To be specific, oriented R-CNN is a two-stage detection framework, which consists of an oriented RPN and an oriented R-CNN head. The first stage generates oriented proposals via oriented RPN. The second stage extracts the features of oriented proposals by rotated RoI alignment and performs classification and regression. More details can refer to our paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05699v1) and source code (https://github.com/jbwang1997/OBBDetection).",
